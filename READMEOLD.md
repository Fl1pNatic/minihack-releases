# MiniMod
## A Discontinued Crab Game cheat.

### Reason of uploading the source code(Pasting from discord message)

Well, all good things should come to an end. MiniMod is no longer maintained or supported.

The game got obfuscated, which means, that unless you work with memory and not the game's functions, then you will have to find and change names of the functions each update. It will take too much time, and it's just not worth it.

Another reason is that I had enough of you all, I keep getting the same question like "How to install" or "BepInEx doesn't generate files", even tho you don't even  need to put any effort in searching for answers to these questions. There always was manual-installation  and faq , but people keep spamming both my DMs, sometimes even DMs of my friends and this server with the same questions. I can't keep doing this anymore. I feel like I am being more and more pressured into releasing and I want to stop this. My interest in the game dropped, and I really don't want to play it. Therefore the motivation to keep going is gone too.

Only reason I don't delete this server is because of all the memories I got from here. 

If you reading this then the source code of the mod will release today in updates. You can do whatever you want with it, as long as you follow the license(LICENSE file in the repository.) And the server will be archived.

If you are interested in me as a developer, then DM me and I will invite you to a special server. 

If we don't account all the issues I encountered while developing this - It was a blast making. I just want to thank you all for the support you gave to me, I could never even think about recieving as much as I got. I made a lot of friends on the way, and I will try to make more things like this for various games in the future.

I want to really thank @muffeen and @daniel_crime for both support and opening my eyes at this issue of me no longer enjoying the development.

You all changed my life in a more interesting way <3

Sincerely, Flip...
